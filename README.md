This is a tool working on Windows to help the download of video and/or audio from Youtube.com. Requires Java installed and https://yt-dl.org/downloads/2018.06.19/youtube-dl.exe to work. For audio conversion, [ffmpeg](https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-prebuilt/releases/download/v3.4/ffmpeg-3.4-win-64.zip) and [ffprobe](https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-prebuilt/releases/download/v3.4/ffprobe-3.4-win-64.zip) are required (unzip the exes and put them in the PATH or the same directory).
You also need Microsoft Redistribuable Visual C++ 2010 if the error "MSVCR100.dll is missing" when you try to launch from command line.
